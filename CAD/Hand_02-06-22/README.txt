Assembling this hand takes some time, but if you want to make it move it's going to take an eternity.
Soldering together 16 PCBs, crimping all of the jumper wires, calibrating setpoints from the potentiometers,
attaching wires and tightnening them etc is very time intensive and very troublesome. Feel free to try,
but we would recommend sticking with assembling the hand itself and maybe the lower arm WITHOUT the motors,
electronics and cables.

For the joints: Mostly M2 screws but with 4 M3 screws near the knuckles as well as an M4 and an M6 in the
base of the thumb.

The torsion springs were made by hand.
